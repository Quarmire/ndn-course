//! A *face* is the forwarder's link to a peer. It's built from two layers (this is
//! how the real engine does it):
//!
//!   * a `Transport` — moves opaque byte frames over some medium, and
//!   * a `LinkService` — frames network-layer packets (tags them with link
//!     metadata) and hands the bytes to the transport.
//!
//! `Face = Transport + LinkService`. You'll implement the classic first transport —
//! an in-memory channel pair (the real tree ships this as `InProcFace`) — and the
//! LinkService framing on top. The real traits are async and trade `bytes::Bytes`;
//! this analog is synchronous and trades `Vec<u8>` so you see the shape without a
//! runtime. Stubs compile; tests are red until you fill them in.
